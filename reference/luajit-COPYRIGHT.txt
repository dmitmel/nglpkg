This program uses LuaJIT, which in turn uses Lua 5.1/5.2 and dlmalloc.

The "Darwin x86_64" build is actually "luajit_real".

The "luajit" application is used to attempt to help stranded Mac OS X Catalina users who have been fucked over by the security policy changes.

The build used was downloaded 
 from https://github.com/luapower/luajit/archive/master.zip

Theoretically, the specific version would be
 https://github.com/luapower/luajit/archive/2.1.0-beta2.zip

They force-pushed the binaries out of existence.
A reliable archive I can find is:
 https://github.com/earl/luajit/tree/fdb362b0092b3866dc040ce8bfb4ea697f26b41b

Unnecessary files have been removed, and a single byte in both Windows EXEs has been changed,
 to change the subsystem from CUI to GUI.
 It's at 0xDC, changed from 0x03 to 0x02.

Files specific to the LuaPower packaging have been omitted,
 and their licensing appears uncertain anyway.

The involved copyright notices are below.
